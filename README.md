# m19-ml-bot
This is a machine learning bot that successfully learned to outpreform the average human at the drafting portion of the card game "magic the gathering" for the set of cards titled M19.  

The dataset used for this project was provided by www.draftsim.com.  
The dataset is available for download here:  https://draftsim.com/draft-data/

The research that prompted this project is found here:  https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.00655.pdf.  

This M19 bot was able to achieve similar accuracy as the paper, around 60%.  My future projects, including Kaldheim, were more successful, with my bot reaching 70% accuracy, from a better pool of drafters.
